Experiment with Responsive CSS and JS

demo: http://philgraci.com/responsive-experiment

The challenge with this experiment was to complete the following using only jQuery, and no CSS framework.

Load data from JSON.

When the page is 560 px or smaller, the items will scroll vertically.  
Items will line up L to R, then continue a new row below.

When the page is larger than 560px, the items will scroll horizontally only.
Items will line up top to bottom, then continue a new column to the right.
As many rows as can fit on the screen will be shown, with the items centered vertically.

Every 4th item has a clickable triangle in the top right corner.  
Clicking the triangle removes it from the layout, and all other items are adjusted.
